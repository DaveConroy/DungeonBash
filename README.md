Dungeon Bash

Dungeon Bash is a 2D roguelike online multiplayer game developed
during my time in college. The game is largely unfinished and was
mainly to showcase the use of websockets, in particular the socket.io
framework. The game is designed to be deployable directly to an OpenShift
RedHat Linux VM running NodeJs. The game is programmed in JavaScript and
some HTML5. The game uses the enchant.js framework for rendering.
